## Yamba

This is the example project that is incrementally built in the
'Learning Android' O'Reilly book. It's basically a twitter/statusnet
client. 

YAMBA stands for Yet Another MicroBlogging App. My initial import is
just after finishing the database chapter.

The O'Reilly errata page is very useful because there are a few
typo/gotchas which others have found and posted. Make sure to also
click on the [unconfirmed errata link](http://oreilly.com/catalog/errataunconfirmed.csp?isbn=0636920010883)
